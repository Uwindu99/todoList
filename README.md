I've successfully developed a dynamic ToDoList application using Express.js and MongoDB, showcasing my proficiency in building full-stack applications. This project highlights my ability to implement custom functionalities and manage data persistence effectively. The application allows users to create personalized task lists in addition to a default list, enabling them to add and delete tasks as needed. Each task, whether added to a custom or the default list, is stored and managed within a MongoDB database, ensuring data integrity and providing a seamless user experience. This project underscores my skills in using route parameters for custom list creation, demonstrating my expertise in RESTful API development and database management.
